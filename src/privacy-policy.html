        <p id="1.1">
            We don't use your data. Our code is hosted on GitHub, so if you want to check that, you can just look at the repository! No data is ever collected that
            is not used for a good cause. No tracking, no passwords, and for crash reports, we ask you if you want to send the report instead of auto-sending them
            like the others. No personal data is ever tracked, and any info that is entered in at setup is stored on your computer, not in the cloud. And if you are
            worried about the primary hard drive failing, just know that we have a clear option to keep your login stored on other hard drives, including an option
            where there are constant backups.
        </p>
        <p id="1.2">
            Now, if SkibiOS got hacked, then none of your data will ever be given to the hackers unless there was an exploit in an update, in which we would fix
            immediately. And if you find yourself in one of these attacks, then send a report immediately and we will only keep the sent data in the cloud for as
            long as it takes for us to recieve the report, in which it will only be used on a hard drive to see what the problem was and the cloud-hosted information
            will be removed from GitHub immediately, and removed from the hard drive when we have a fix ready, in which you will get an email with instructions on how
            to recover your SkibiOS install, with the fixed version of your files attatched. The email will automatically be deleted after a week, so if you missed
            the email send a report that includes some proof that it is you.
        </p>
        <p id="1.3">
            How do we trust this "GitHub"? Well, GitHub is a platform for hosting code on the cloud, and currently this website is being hosted on GitHub. If there
            was a breach in SkibiOS, it would be in GitHub, but we can't exactly trust it. But for SkibiOS, if GitHub gets a data breach that can't be fixed by the
            hundreds of millions of developers using this platform (Which is a <i>very</i> low chance) we will move our code to either another cloud provider or 
            to our own servers. This is a very low chance though.
        </p>
        <p id="1.4">
            We do not take responsibility if third-party applications use your data, but we do offer certain solutions to these data collectors. We have a powerful
            browser based on firefox, but stripped down to just the accessing of the internet and the browser tools. For a word editor, we include LibreOffice as
            the default word processor. You can change this in settings, or by using third-party applications but we do not take any responsibility if you do. We
            do also include a few applications that are required by most powerusers.

            Article 2. Hosting apps on the app store
        </b>
        <p id="2.1">
            When hosting your app on the SkibiOS app store, you will have to include a privacy statement before uploading it. We require that in the statement you
            include all the ways that you collect data. If you don't collect data, then include the ways you don't include data. The policy on collecting data from
            SkibiOS users is that you can only take the relative location, Name, Email or Password of mentioned user. Apps that require payments are required to
            have an inspection before they get uploaded.
        </p>
        <p id="2.2">
            We do allow the distribution of SkibiOS-exclusive software, but it is only allowed to be distributed on first-party app marketplaces, or SkibiOS approved
            third-party marketplaces. You are not allowed to make money off SkibiOS-exclusive apps, and if these apps are found being sold for money we will
            request you to remove the app, or it may end up in a lawsuit. We are very motivated by free software for all.
        </p>
        <p id="2.3">
            These are the approved third-party app stores for redistribution of SkibiOS software: Windows store, Apple app store, Steam, Homebrew, MacPorts, Epic games,
            Any linux distrobution's store, VSCode store (Selected apps), Chrome web store, Opera store, GitHub (Only if credit to the original creators is listed).
            To suggest app stores, email <a href="https://skibioperatingsystem@gmail.com">skibioperatingsystem@gmail.com</a>.

        <p id="2.4">
            SkibiOS is not to be distributed or sold on any website that is not official. Selling SkibiOS is especially not allowed, and the same process of punishment
            for selling SkibiOS apps on non-approved websites will be practised. Distribution of modified SkibiOS is allowed, as long as there is no affriliation with
            the original copy of SkibiOS. Malware or trackers are not to be included with the modified SkibiOS, and the modified SkibiOS is only allowed to be redistributed
            on GitHub or the SkibiOS app store.
